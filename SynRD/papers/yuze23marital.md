Step 1: Create a skeleton for the class
---------------------------------------

```python
import pandas as pd
from SynRD.publication import Publication

class Yuze23Marital(Publication):
    def __init__(self, dataframe=None):
        super().__init__(dataframe=dataframe)
```

Here, we import necessary libraries and create a class named `Yuze23Marital` that inherits from `Publication`. The `__init__` method accepts an optional dataframe parameter and calls the parent class's `__init__` method with the same parameter.

Step 2: Find the dataset, download it, and obtain the codebook and the excel file with waves 1-5 crosswalk
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this step, you will need to find the dataset mentioned in the paper, download it, and obtain the codebook and the excel file with waves 1-5 crosswalk. The dataset should be in a tab-separated values (TSV) format. The codebook will help you understand the variables in the dataset, and the excel file will provide information on how the variables change across waves.

Step 3: Read the paper and write out the parts which describe the features from the dataset
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Read the paper and identify the features mentioned in the paper that correspond to variables in the dataset. For instance, the paper might discuss marital satisfaction, stressful life events, and depressive symptoms. Write down the variable codes from the codebook that represent these features.

Step 4: Find the feature codes for each of the described variables, and write them to the class
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```python
class Yuze23Marital(Publication):
    ...
    INPUT_FILES = ["data/04690-0001-Data.tsv"]

    GENERAL_INFO = {
        ...
    }

    MARITAL_SATISFACTION = {
        ...
    }

    STRESSFUL_LIFE_EVENTS = {
        ...
    }

    DEPRESSIVE_SYMPTOMS = {
        ...
    }

    DEPRESSIVE_SYMPTOMS_IMPUTED = {
        ...
    }
```

In the class definition, define dictionaries that map the variable codes to human-readable feature names. These dictionaries include `GENERAL_INFO`, `MARITAL_SATISFACTION`, `STRESSFUL_LIFE_EVENTS`, `DEPRESSIVE_SYMPTOMS`, and `DEPRESSIVE_SYMPTOMS_IMPUTED`.

Step 5: Create a code to read the dataframe, using the previously defined columns
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


```python
class Yuze23Marital(Publication):
    ...
    @classmethod
    def _recreate_dataframe(cls, filename="yuze23marital_dataframe.pickle") -> pd.DataFrame:
        assert len(cls.INPUT_FILES) == 1
        file_path = cls.INPUT_FILES[0]

        COLUMN_MAP = (
            cls.GENERAL_INFO
            | cls.MARITAL_SATISFACTION
            | cls.STRESSFUL_LIFE_EVENTS
            | cls.DEPRESSIVE_SYMPTOMS
            | cls.DEPRESSIVE_SYMPTOMS_IMPUTED
        )
        df = pd.read_csv(file_path, sep="\t", usecols=COLUMN_MAP.keys())
        df = df.rename(columns=COLUMN_MAP)

        ...
        return df
```

Define a class method named `_recreate_dataframe` that reads the dataset using the previously defined column dictionaries. It takes an optional parameter `filename` with a default value of "yuze23marital\_dataframe.pickle". This method reads the TSV file and selects the necessary columns based on the dictionaries defined earlier. It then renames the columns to more readable names.

Step 6: Create checks for each simple statistic, described in the paper
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


```python
class Yuze23Marital(Publication):
    ...
    def __init__(self, dataframe=None):
        super().__init__(dataframe=dataframe)

    @classmethod
    def _recreate_dataframe(cls, ...):
        ...
        # Check if the number of rows in the dataframe matches the paper's description
        assert len(df) == 3617

        ...
        df = df[df["Year of W2"] == 1989]
        assert len(df) == 2867
        assert round(len(df) / n_alive, 2) == 0.83

        ...
        assert df['Sex 1'].value_counts().to_dict() == {2: 777, 1: 615}

        ...
        return df
```


In the `_recreate_dataframe` method, we add various assertions to ensure that the dataframe's statistics match the paper's description. These assertions help verify that the data is being processed correctly.

Step 7: Find where the asserts fall, and figure out which columns were found incorrectly
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If any of the assertions fail, this means that there is a discrepancy between the paper's description and the dataframe. In this case, you should investigate the cause of the failure. The problem could be due to incorrect column mappings or some other issue with the data processing.

You may need to adjust the column mappings or modify the data processing steps to fix the issue. Once all assertions pass, you can be more confident that the data is being processed correctly.
