Variables:

Text comes from the paper

Use ICPSR to look for relevant variables to get variable code and directory/file.

We copied that result here.

Predictors:
Time in Years 
We constructed this variable to indicate the time in years that the data were collected from the study participants at each wave or observation (Time = 0 [1995], Time = 1 [1996], Time = 6 [2001], and Time = 13 [2008]). The following predictors were measured at all waves.

From Paper:

Marijuana Use 
Frequency Marijuana use was measured by asking the participants to indicate, “During the past 30 days, how many times did you use marijuana?”.

Illicit Drug Use The participants were asked “How old were you when you first tried any other type of illicit drugs, such as LSD, PCP, ecstasy, mushrooms, speed, ice, heroin, or pills, without a doctor’s prescription? If you never tried any other type of illicit drug, enter “0.” This variable was dichotomized (tried any other illicit drug = 1 and never tried any illicit drug = 0).
