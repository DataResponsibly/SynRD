Abstract
Background
Understanding differences in cigarette smoking patterns such as the frequency between-person and within-person is essential for tailored tobacco health education interventions. Previous studies, however, mostly limited analysis to computation of cigarette smoking frequency and its correlates. This article used multilevel models to examine between-person and within-person variations in cigarette smoking patterns over a 13-year period.

Methods
We merged the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health public-use data waves 1–4 into one longitudinal dataset for use in this study. Our analysis was based on the past-month’s average number of cigarette smoked per day. We used linear mixed model approach to fit multilevel models.

Results
The average number of cigarette smoked per day (CPD) among the sample at baseline/wave 1 was 6.92 (SD = 8.18). Time of observation in years (β = 0.455 (p < .001), age (β = 0.355, p < .001), past-year alcohol use frequency (β = −0.329, p < .001), and illicit drug use (β = 1.128, p < .001) were associated with average number of CPD. There were significant variations in the average number of CPD between-person (β = 29.602, p < .001) and within-person (variance = 34.393, p < .001).
