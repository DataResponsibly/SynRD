## Progress towards benchmark inclusion?
1. [X] This paper will not be included in benchmark
2. [ ] This paper is not yet ready to be included in benchmark

### Reason if (1)
This paper was not sufficiently reproducible in the following ways:
1. Part of the necessary sample to their analysis is based on the private sample (not the public data we have access to).
2. The linear models from their are insufficiently documented for us to replicate.

Other reasons for not including:
1. The paper is itself behind a paywall - unclear the ramifications of this.
2. The journal the paper is in has a relatively low impact score, compared to papers we have included in the benchmark.

### Reason if (2)
N/A (here, we will put necessary steps that need to happen before paper is ready to be included in benchmark)
